tags.conf.spec
# Version 10.0.0
#
# This file contains possible attribute/value pairs for configuring tags. Set
# any number of tags for indexed or extracted fields.
#
# There is no tags.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/. To set custom
# configurations, place a tags.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. For
# examples, see tags.conf.example. You must restart Splunk software to enable
# configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the

[<fieldname>=<value>]
* The field name and value to which the tags in the stanza
apply. For example, host=localhost.
* A tags.conf file can contain multiple stanzas. It is recommended that the
value be URL encoded to avoid configuration file parsing errors, especially
if the field value contains the following characters: \n, =, []
* Each stanza can refer to only one field/value pair.

<tag1> = <enabled|disabled>
<tag2> = <enabled|disabled>
<tag3> = <enabled|disabled>
* Enable or disable each <tag> for this specific field/value pair.
* While you can have multiple tags in a stanza (meaning that multiple tags are
assigned to the same field/value combination), only one tag is allowed per
stanza line. In other words, you can't have a list of tags on one line of the
stanza.
* CAUTION: Do not put the <tag> value in quotes. For example,
use foo=enabled, not "foo"=enabled.

# Version 10.0.0

# This is an example tags.conf. Use this file to define tags for fields.
#
# To use one or more of these configurations, copy the configuration block into
# tags.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. You must restart Splunk to
# enable configurations.

# This first example presents a situation where the field is "host" and the
# three hostnames for which tags are being defined are "hostswitch,"
# "emailbox," and "devmachine." Each hostname has two tags applied to it, one
# per line. Note also that the "building1" tag has been applied to two hostname
# values (emailbox and devmachine).

[host=hostswitch]
pci = enabled
cardholder-dest = enabled

[host=emailbox]

building1 = enabled

[host=devmachine]

building1 = enabled
