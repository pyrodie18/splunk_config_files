event_renderers.conf.spec
# Version 9.4.3
#
# This file contains possible attribute/value pairs for configuring event rendering properties.
#
# Beginning with version 6.0, Splunk Enterprise does not support the
# customization of event displays using event renderers.
#
# There is an event_renderers.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/. To set custom configurations,
# place an event_renderers.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/, or your own custom app directory.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the documentation
# located at http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
# * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top of the file.
# * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are multiple default
# stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of multiple definitions of the same
# attribute, the last definition in the file wins.
# * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific stanza, the
# value in the specific stanza takes precedence.
[<name>]
* Stanza name. This name must be unique.

eventtype = <event type>
* Specify event type name from eventtypes.conf.

priority = <positive integer>
* Highest number wins!!

template = <valid Mako template>
* Any template from the $APP/appserver/event_renderers directory.

css_class = <css class name suffix to apply to the parent event element class attribute>
* This can be any valid css class value.
* The value is appended to a standard suffix string of "splEvent-". A css_class value of foo would
result in the parent element of the event having an html attribute class with a value of splEvent-foo
(for example, class="splEvent-foo"). You can externalize your css style rules for this in
$APP/appserver/static/application.css. For example, to make the text red you would add to
application.css:.splEvent-foo { color:red; }
