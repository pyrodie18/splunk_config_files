passwords.conf.spec
# Version 9.4.2
#
# This file maintains the credential information for a given app in Splunk Enterprise.
#
# There is no global, default passwords.conf. Instead, anytime a user creates
# a new user or edit a user onwards hitting the storage endpoint
# will create this passwords.conf file which gets replicated
# in a search head clustering enviornment.
# Note that passwords.conf is only created from 6.3.0 release.
#
# You must restart Splunk Enterprise to reload manual changes to passwords.conf.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the
# documentation located at

[credential:<realm>:<username>:]
password = <password>
* The password that corresponds to the given username for the given realm.
* NOTE: The realm is optional.
* The password can be in clear text, however when saved from splunkd the
password will always be encrypted.

passwords.conf.example
# Version 9.4.2
#
# The following are example passwords.conf configurations. Configure properties for
# your custom application.
#
# There is NO DEFAULT passwords.conf. The file only gets created once you add/edit
# a credential information via the storage endpoint as follows.
#
# The POST request to add user1 credentials to the storage/password endpoint
# curl -k -u admin:changeme https://localhost:8089/servicesNS/nobody/search/storage/passwords -d name=user1 -d password=changeme2
#
# The GET request to list all the credentials stored at the storage/passwords endpoint
# curl -k -u admin:changeme https://localhost:8089/services/storage/passwords
#
# To use one or more of these configurations, copy the configuration block into
# passwords.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/<apps>/local/. You must restart Splunk to
# enable configurations.
#
