# Version 9.4.4
#
# This file explains how to format viewstates.
#
# To use this configuration, copy the configuration block into
# viewstates.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. You must restart Splunk
# to enable configurations.

# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see

GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
# * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top
# of the file.
# * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
# multiple default stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of
# multiple definitions of the same attribute, the last definition in the
# file wins.
# * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific
# stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.
[<view_name>:<viewstate_id>]
* Auto-generated persistence stanza label that corresponds to UI views
* The <view_name> is the URI name (not label) of the view to persist
* if <view_name> = "*", then this viewstate is considered to be 'global'
* The <viewstate_id> is the unique identifier assigned to this set of
parameters
* <viewstate_id> = '_current' is a reserved name for normal view
'sticky state'
* <viewstate_id> = '_empty' is a reserved name for no persistence,
i.e., all defaults

<module_id>.<setting_name> = <string>
* The <module_id> is the runtime id of the UI module requesting persistence
* The <setting_name> is the setting designated by <module_id> to persist
