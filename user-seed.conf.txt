# Specification for user-seed.conf.  Allows configuration of Splunk's initial username and password.
# Currently, only one user can be configured with user-seed.conf.
#
# To set the default username and password, place user-seed.conf in 
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local. You must restart Splunk to enable configurations.
# If the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd file is present, the settings in this file (user-seed.conf) are not used.
#
# Use HASHED_PASSWORD for a more secure installation. To hash a clear-text password,
# use the 'splunk hash-passwd' command then copy the output to this file.
#
# If a clear text password is set (not recommended) and last character is '\', it should
# be followed by a space for value to be read correctly. Password does not include extra
# space at the end, it is required to ignore the special meaning of backslash in conf file.

# This is an example user-seed.conf.  Use this file to create an initial login.

# NOTE: When starting Splunk for first time, hash of password is stored in
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/user-seed.conf and password file is seeded
# with this hash. This file can also be used to set default username and
# password, if $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd is not present. If the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd
# file is present, the settings in this file (user-seed.conf) 
# are not used.
#
# To use this configuration, copy the configuration block into user-seed.conf 
# in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. You must restart Splunk to enable configurations.
