ignored_model_keywords = <space-separated list of terms>
* Terms to ignore when generating a sourcetype model.
* To prevent sourcetype "bundles/learned/*-model.xml" files from containing
sensitive terms (e.g. "bobslaptop") that occur very frequently in your
data files, add those terms to ignored_model_keywords.

ignored_filename_keywords = <space-separated list of terms>
* Terms to ignore when comparing a new sourcename against a known
sourcename, for the purpose of classifying a source.
